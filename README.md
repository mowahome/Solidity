# Solidity

The goal of this project was to automate the creation of joint savings accounts, by creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
#### Step 1: Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
Define a new contract named `JointSavings`.
Define the following variables in the new contract:

    * Two variables of type `address payable` named `accountOne` and `accountTwo`

    * A variable of type `address public` named `lastToWithdraw`

    * Two variables of type `uint public` named `lastWithdrawAmount` and `contractBalance`


Define a function named `withdraw` that accepts two arguments: `amount` of type `uint` and `recipient` of type `payable address`. In this function, code the following:

    * Define a `require` statement that checks if `recipient` is equal to either `accountOne` or `accountTwo`. If it isn’t, the `require` statement returns the “You don't own this account!” text.

    * Define a `require` statement that checks if `balance` is sufficient for accomplishing the withdrawal operation. If there are insufficient funds, it returns the “Insufficient funds!” text.

    * Add an `if` statement to check if `lastToWithdraw` is not equal (`!=`) to `recipient`. If it’s not equal, set it to the current value of `recipient`.

    * Call the `transfer` function of the `recipient`, and pass it the `amount` to transfer as an argument.

    * Set `lastWithdrawAmount` equal to `amount`.

    * Set the `contractBalance` variable equal to the balance of the contract by using `address(this).balance` to reflect the new balance of the contract.


Define a `public payable` function named `deposit`. In this function, code the following:

    * Set the `contractBalance` variable equal to the balance of the contract by using `address(this).balance`.

Define a `public` function named `setAccounts` that takes two `address payable` arguments, named `account1` and `account2`. In the body of the function, set the values of `accountOne` and `accountTwo` to `account1` and `account2`, respectively.

Add a fallback function so that your contract can store ether that’s sent from outside the deposit function.

## Results

The folder named `Execution_Results` contains at least eight images that confirm that the deposit and withdrawal transactions, which are designed to test the `JointSavings` functionality in the JavaScript VM, worked as expected.
